#' Compute Expected Evolutionary Distinctiveness
#'
#' This is simple package to calculate expected Phylogenetic Diversity (expected PD) and expected Evolutionary Distinctiveness (expected ED) for each tip of a phylogenetic tree.
#'
#' Currently, \pkg{mallorn} has two functions: \code{\link{ePD}} and \code{\link{eED}}. \code{\link{ePD}} calculates expected PD, the expected amount of evolutionary history represented by a community. \code{\link{eED}} calculates expected ED, the expected amount of unique evolutionary history belonging to each taxon.
