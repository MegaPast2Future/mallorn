# mallorn
`mallorn` is an R package for calculating expected Phylogenetic Diversity and Evolutionary Distinctiveness

![mallorn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31075082/33756280-059d7e6a-dbf5-11e7-9735-e9110da58421.png)

This package provides functions for calculating probabilistic phylogenetic diversity metrics. These metrics are neccesary when there is uncertainty whether a taxon is present or absent in a community. This uncertainty could arise, for example, from sampling uncertainty, the continuous output of a species distribution model, or a species' extinction probability. If the probability of species being in a community is binary (0 or 1), you can use the functions in the [`picante`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/picante/index.html) pacakge. But if the probability of species being in a community is 0.67, you need to use the probablistic metrics found in `mallorn`.

Warning! This package is still in developement. Use it with caution.

#### Citation

The indices used in `mallorn` are described in the supplemental material for [Davis M, Faurby S, Svenning JC (2018) Mammal diversity will take millions of years to recover from the current biodiversity crisis. PNAS.](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/10/09/1804906115)


#### Installation

To install it from its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/mallorn). You first need to
install the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install `mallorn` using the `install_github` function in the
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package.

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("MegaPast2Future/mallorn")
```

#### Example use

To calculate expected Phylogenetic Diversity, use the `ePD` function. Expected PD is the expected amount of evolutionary history represeneted in a community.

```r
library(ape)
library(mallorn)

data(bear_tree)
data(bear_matrix)

ePD(tree=bear_tree, probabilities.tips.present.matrix=bear_matrix)
```


To calculate expected Evolutionary Distinctiveness, use the `eED` function. Expected ED is the expected amount of evolutionary history represented by each individual taxon.

```r
library(ape)
library(mallorn)

data(bear_tree)
data(bear_probs)

eED(tree=bear_tree, probabilities.tips.present=bear_probs)
```


`mallorn` can also predict expected PD and ED given future evolution.

```r
library(ape)
library(mallorn)

data(bear_tree)
data(bear_probs)
data(bear_matrix)

ePD(tree=bear_tree, probabilities.tips.present.matrix=bear_matrix, lambda=0.276, mu=0.272, tMa=2)

eED(tree=bear_tree, probabilities.tips.present=bear_probs, lambda=0.276, mu=0.272, tMa=2)
```


The output of `eED` can be used to plot phylogenies where each edge is colored by its probability of extinction.

```r
library(ape)
library(mallorn)

# To install the ggtree package from Bioconductor
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("ggtree")
library(ggtree)

data(bear_tree)
data(bear_probs)

# Calculate expected ED
res <- eED(tree=bear_tree, probabilities.tips.present=bear_probs)

# Extract internal node and edge values
edge.values <- res$edge.values

# Have to change the name of the label column so that data matches up with ggtree
colnames(edge.values)[1] <- "node"


# Create ggtree object
p <- ggtree(bear_tree, layout="rectangular", aes(color=Prob.Edge.Extinct.t), size=1)

#  Put in the edge values
p2 <- p %<+% as.data.frame(edge.values)

# Construct plot
p3 <- p2+
  geom_tiplab()+
  # Add a color scale to show extinction probability
  scale_color_gradient2(name="Probability\nof extinction", low="dodgerblue2", mid="bisque", high="red1", midpoint=.50, guide="colorbar")+
  # Must explicitly place the legend
  theme(legend.position="right")+
  # Leave some room for tip labels
  xlim_tree(max(branching.times(bear_tree))*1.7)

print(p3)
```

#### Roadmap 

Sometime in the next couple months, we hope to add `mallorn` to CRAN and to add a function for calculating SÃ¸rensen's branch based similiarity index. This will allow the user to compare the phylogenetic similiarity of two communities using non-binary species presence or absence probabilities.
